# Documentation Tool

The `DocuCheck` is a command line tool, written in Swift, that collects and validates documentation written in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). The tool does following main tasks:

- Collects documentation from various remote sources (typically from a remote git repository).
- Copies all predefined folders containing documentation into one predefined folder.
- Validates all links pointing to another documents or to anchors in the documents.
- Patches all documents to be easily served on Wultra's [developers portal](https://developers.wultra.com).

The tool was developed for Wultra's internal purposes, so it's highly specialized for what we need for our documentation. If you're still interested, then please visit [DocuCheck's documentation](docs/Readme.md).
